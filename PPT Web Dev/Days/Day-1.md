### Day-7

**Meta Tag**

Data about the data

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width", initial-scale="1.0"/>
<meta name="description" content=""/>
<meta name="author" content=""/>
<meta name="keyword" content=""/>
```

**Semantics Tag**

Use  of Semantics is it add meaning to tags as well as  Accessibility(i.e in screen reader if you use <strong> instead of  <b> the screen reader emphasize that word,)

And good for developer to understand. 


**HTML5 Tags**

```
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<section></section>
<article></article>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>
```
    XML: Extensible Markup Language
    XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

**    XML doesn't have predefined tags, we have to define our own tags.**

    USE OF XML:
    1. Data Transfer
    2. Data Storage
    3. Data Manipulation
    4. Data Validation

    then what is the difference XML and JSON?

    XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are both popular data interchange formats used in web development. While they serve a similar purpose of representing structured data, there are some differences between the two:

    **Syntax:** XML uses custom tags to define elements and attributes, while JSON uses key-value pairs to represent data.

    **Readability: ** JSON is generally considered more readable and easier to understand than XML. JSON has a simpler syntax and is often used in JavaScript-based applications.

    **Data Types:** XML supports various data types like string, number, boolean, etc., whereas JSON has limited data types, mainly string, number, boolean, null, array, and object.

    **Extensibility:** XML allows for more extensibility due to its support for custom tags and namespaces. JSON, on the other hand, has a fixed schema and is more suitable for simple data structures.

    Size: JSON tends to be more compact than XML, resulting in smaller file sizes and faster transmission over networks.

    Parsing: JSON can be parsed more easily and quickly compared to XML because of its simpler syntax.

    Usage: XML is commonly used in enterprise systems, document storage, and data exchange between different systems. JSON is widely used in web APIs and for data transfer between web applications.

    In summary, XML is more flexible and suited for complex data structures, while JSON is simpler, more lightweight, and widely used in web development. The choice between XML and JSON depends on the specific requirements of your project and the tools and technologies you are using.
